# Code and Design Decisions

There were some minor differences in the Figma file that I decided not to make in my code. For example, there were different margins:
- between listings
- between the heart icon and the top/right edge of thumbnail
- between listing container and left side of window

Sometimes there differences were only 1-3px, sometimes 20px+. I decided to pick the amount that looked best for each situation and stay consistent. Normally I would ask the designer about these issues.

## Accessibility Issues

When running accessibility checks with axe dev tools, it does flag a "serious" issue with the lack of sufficient color contrast, but that's based on the design, so it would be another issue to bring up with the designer.
